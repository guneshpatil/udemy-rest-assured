# udemy-rest-assured
This is the repository for the Udemy Course https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-automation-testing-rest-assured/ by Rahul Shetty.

I have tried to incorporate my frameowrk experience and some advaced techniques from https://testautomationu.applitools.com/automating-your-api-tests-with-rest-assured course by https://github.com/basdijkstra and built it as a real life project.

Opinions and Feedbacks welcome! :)
